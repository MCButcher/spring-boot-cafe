### Specifications
Implement a Repository for an H2 Database for the **Menu** so that the **MenuService** gets the data from there.
A suitable implementation for **Category** is already done.

### Tasks
- Add a **MenuRepository**
- Adapt the model **Menu**
- Adapt the **MenuService** and **MenuController**
- Initialize the database with some random items after startup.

### Goals
- When calling the endpoints for the **Menu**, all actions have to lead to the database so that the data is stored and updated in it.
